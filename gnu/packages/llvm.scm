     "LLVM is a compiler infrastructure designed for compile-time, link-time, runtime,
and idle-time optimization of programs from arbitrary programming languages.
It currently supports compilation of C and C++ programs, using front-ends
derived from GCC 4.0.1.  A new front-end for the C family of languages is in
development.  The compiler infrastructure includes mirror sets of programming
tools as well as libraries with equivalent functionality.")
